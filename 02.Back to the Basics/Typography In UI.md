# Typography in UI

==95% of what we see on screen is text based language. We are dependent on typography.==

" Today we are inundated with such an immense flood of printed matter that the value of the individual work has depreciated, for our harassed contemporaries simply cannot take everything that is printed today.
It is the typographer's task to divide up and organize and interpret this mass of printed matter in such a way that the reader will have a good chance of finding what is of interest to him. "
- Emil Ruder | Swiss typographer (1969) -

" Typography has one plain duty before it and that is to convey information in writing.
No argument or consideration can absolve typography from this duty.
A printed work which cannot be read becomes a product without purpose.
- Emil Ruder | Swiss typographer (1969) -

==Typography creates emotional impact, is the voice in your head who reads it. The voice in your head changes depending on typography.==

## Typography serves a functional purpose:
- Readability
- Accessibility
- Usability
- Visual Balance

All of them work together to form effective, understandable visual communication.

==CHOSING A FONT IS NOT TYPOGRAPHY== 
Everyone can download a font.
Not everyone knows how to treat text as visual design -  utilizing size, weight, space and style combinations - to establish visual order, signals relationships and enhance understand.

Typography is not about choosing fonts.

==Typography is about purposefully combining letterforms to create optimal reading experiences - witch deliver appropriate emotional impact.==

## Pattern recognition
Typography is made of shapes that forms a pattern -> the more you abstract the pattern, the harder it is to recognise the shape and the letter.
A font ca be visually interesting and not readable at the same time (takes more time to read).

## Alignment 
Left alignment - easier to read because there is a a common starting point
Centre alignment - is hardest to read because the starting points are all over the place, so the brain has to work more to find where to start reading

==Paragraphs NEVER have a centre alignment!!!==

## Kerning
Kerning is the space between letters. It is critical to legibility, readability and comprehension.
==The space between letters should be filled with the same volume of water==
(between words as well)
A couple of anomalies are ok.

## Leading
==Leading== is the space between lines of text. In terms of UI design, is called ==line height==
Increasing leading makes text easier to scan and read, makes comprehension a lot faster.
It serves to visually group related "chunks" of information.


Tips:
- Wrong kernel can be used as a contrast element.
- Treat text as shapes in blocks to understand the relationships between elements.
- UI design is also about how things are easy to use not just how things looks.
- Proximity is key in typography 

# 7 Rules for great typography

## Two typefaces MAX
- No more than two fonts families.
- Character widths and weights of each font should be complementary to the other.
EG: Avenir and Georgia have similar character widths, that creates visual harmony.
- At the same time, font pairings needs to have some visual difference; otherwise there's no reason to use the second font.
- You use two typefaces just because it is easy to the user to understand what tare the related information.

## Limit line width
When line lengths are too wide, the eye has to work more to track the text. Is good practice to use:
- 60 characters per line on monitors.
- 3o-40 characters on mobile.
Using these sizes allows the userr to understand the information

## Choose readability
Text is used in many situations, so typefaces you choose have to be readable at all sizes.
Usually users view on different devices wit different screen sizes and resolutions.
Choose typefaces that not degrade (fall apart) at small sizes.

## Choose legibility 
Make sure all letterforms are clearly distinguishable in the typeface.
- "l" looks like "i",
- Combination of "r" and "n" that looks like an "m",
- "f" and "i" that looks like "H"

==Google fonts have good Kernel==

## Use space between paragraphs
Visual breacks between paragraphs give the eye a place to "rest", and speeds the speed and the understanding of the piece.
A good use of white space between paragraphs (top, bottom, left and right) increases comprehension by 20%.
- The Leading (space between lines) needs to be half of the character height.

## Align text elements in layout using baselines
When you have multiple text elements on a single screen, they need to share points of "common alignment".
even text that is unrelated need to have the same base line.

## Use styles to visually differentiate content
Usually there are three styles: regular, italic and bold, if you use them effectively you don't need to use a second font.
Usually in an interface there are these items:

- Category
- Item
- Headline
- Credit
- Body
- Subhead
- Accent

Use the three styles to fit all the needs of a page
