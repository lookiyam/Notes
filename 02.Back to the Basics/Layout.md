# LAYOUT - Principles of Design
## Balance
Arrange positive and negative elements so that one don't overpower the other. Ensuring that everything works fine. When a composition is unbalanced the elements are competing with themselves. 

==Balance creates visual order + signals relationships.==

Tips: 
- Clarify how each element is related to one another.
- Few and small Gaps between elements
- Make the eye move between groups rather than individual elements
- Make groups of related information
- Abstract the design to see if it works and count the elements, less elements the better.
- Make: This, than this, than this, than this game
- Negative substitute design elements like "rules"
- Extra rules are just distractions
- Make an abstraction with Black background and white Elements, than draw arrows form left to right from 	top to bottom

## Rhythm
Rhythm occurs when the intervals between elements are predictable - similar in size, shape and length.
Imagine the design like music, made of elements=notes and space=pauses.
If you create structure, you also have to control it. 
More visual information -> bigger the structure -> the harder is the work of control.

==Two or more of anything implies related structure==
==visual rhythm seeds comprehension and use== 

## Harmony
When visual elements are in harmony, they relate to and complement each other. Is the key make a big whole. It comes form rhythm and repetition. Repetition emphasizes visual elements.

==Harmony is a visual "echo"==

size shape and placement is also harmonious

Tip
- Make sure to give a direction -> use arrows to guide the eye.
- Use ==Purposeful Anomalies== to break the pattern -> shorter or longer arrows or gaps.
- If you do something once make it twice ad repeat forever.
- Draw arrows to ensure you get the flow.

==Good design is held together with harmony==

## Dominance
Commanding, controlling, prevailing over all other elements.
Dominance is a matter of: contrast, placement and appearance.
Dominance is achieved by adding details to a single element
Dominance is the focal point. It scream START HERE!
Dominance enables and directs flow.
Dominance is strictly related to hierarchy.
A Dominant element reveals the most important part of the design.
Dominance is Anomaly.

Tips:
- Place the primary element, direct the flow placing secondary and tertiary dominant elements.
- Make sure that the dominant element is the one who has more contrast in the design.

==How big something is does not matter, it can still speak dominance if it is surrounded by negative space==
