# 5 Rules
1. Focus on context of use
	- When they are going to use it>
2. Simplify
	- Every screen needs to contain ==ONLY ONE PRIMARY ACTION==
	- Abandon the idea that numbers of screens or steps matters. It doesn't
3. Design for thumbs
	- Majority of people use thumbs so place important action for thumbs
4. Design for fat fingers
	- Controls and their associated tap targets should be
		==MINIMUM 9 mm = 48px==
    - Provide space between targets
    - Icon and space can be inside the 48px
5. Minimize the need to type
	- typing on a phone is pain
	- use auto complete 
	- keep short and simple

==ON SMALL SCREENS LESS IS MORE==
