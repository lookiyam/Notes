# Compositing Idea Plan

## One Line description

Motion graphics show reel made with Blender, Fusion and After Effects.

## Long Description

As a general guideline, every video idea have to start with:

* main goal of the video

* mood

* song

* phase

* storyboard

* type of graphics

* techniques

* software

* plugins

* workflow

* references

The video has the goal of showcasing my motion graphics and design skills.
This means that it will need to show different kind of skills such as: 

- Text animations,

- camera animations,

- procedural animations,

- procedural texturing,

- procedural texturing animations,

- particles simulations,

- hair simulations,

- liquid simulations,

- mixed composting techniques

 All my projects starts with one element: the music. The music allows the ideas to flow in a specific way, identifying the mood, the phase, the amount of compositions and cuts needed to achieve a certain rhythm. The Music that I have chosen is this:

As can be easily noticed, this song defines a dark mood, fast jump cuts, a very long intro, and since I have only 40 seconds available, I need to have at least 10 to 12 compositions that might be repeated to fill some gaps. Since I need to have specific kind of simulations, I will not be able to keep always a dark mood, that means that probably I will need to colour correct the clips afterwards.

Regarding the tools I have a huge problem. The industry standards for motion graphics are Maxon Cinema 4D and After Effects; and I don't have enough skills to use both of them. My tools for this project will be:

* Blender 3D v.2.83.8
  
  * Eevee (Renderer)
  
  * Alembic Export (Plugin)
  
  * Node Wrangler (Plugin)
  
  * Animation Nodes (Plugin)
  
  * Sverchok (Plugin)
  
  * Commotion (Plugin)
  
  * BY-GEN (Plugin)
  
  * Animax (Plugin)
  
  * Text FX (Plugin)
  
  * SSGI (Plugin)
  
  * Tissue Tool (Plugin)
  
  * Ivy Gen (Plugin)

* DaVinci Resolve / Fusion

* 3DCoat

* Quixel Mixer

* DAZ 3D

* Adobe After Effects (Only if needed)

* Affinity Photo
  
  * Google Nick Collection (Plugin)

* Affinity Designer

* Affinity Publisher

* WPS Office

* Mark Text

* Mega Sync

* GitHub

I choose this set of tools for many different reasons:

* Blender, 3DCoat and DaVinci Resolve are multi purpose tools and I have a very loose and unprecise creative process where I need to go back and forward between tools all the time; these tools grant me a very large amount of freedom.

* Since, I am mainly a freelancer, I have an amount of costs that can not be overseen. These tools are fairly cheap in comparison of most industry standard tools.

* I choose Blender because my hardware is not that performant and I will not be able to render with the Cinema 4D Physical renderer or Redshift, and Maya Arnold would take too much time to render simulations or an high amount of iterations between objects. Blender comes with Eevee that is a physically based real-time renderer. Thanks to Eevee I won't need of a render farm.

* I choose 3DCoat just in case I need a wider 3d sculpting and texturing tool that is interfaced very well with Quixel Mixer.

* I will probably use After Effects for some simple editing technique and straightforward motion graphics.

* I use a huge amount of plugins for Blender because it lacks a lot of tools that are useful for motion graphics. Some plugins are shipped with Blender such as Alembic import/export ()that is needed to cache certain simulations and models inside the system).

* DAZ 3D is a tool with rigged characters presents. DAZ 3D with the Adobe Mixamo service will allow me to streamline the characters animation pipeline.

* I will use DaVinci Fusion not because I'm good at it, but because this is the right opportunity to implement another multi purpose tool in my arsenal.

* I will use the Affinity and WPS Office suite because I don't need the advanced tools that Photoshop InDesign, Illustrator and the Microsoft office suite offers.

* MarkText is the tool I use to take any notes, It is just an editor that allows me to take notes in Markdown language (I'm just used to this software and this way of taking notes).

* I use Git Hub to store all my notes and the Mega service to store all my files in cloud.

In 7 years of freelancing as Graphic Designer and 3D Generalist, I created my own pipeline with the previously mentioned software.

## Projects

**All the projects will be rendered in 8 bit PNG 1920x1080 or 1080x1080 (Some projects will be used for my Instagram account and the renders with the cropped size will used to fill the gaps between clips), 24 fps. The final montage will be done in AE (Even If not suggested, I necessarily need an AE effect to give my desired mood to the final video). The final video will be rendered in 1920 x 1080 24fps.**
