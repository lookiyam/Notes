# Compositing Idea Plan

## One Line description

Motion graphics show reel made with Blender, Fusion and After Effects.
Something along these lines:

## Long Description

As a general guideline, every video idea have to start with:

* main goal of the video

* mood

* song

* phase

* storyboard

* type of graphics

* techniques

* software

* plugins

* workflow

* references

The video has the goal of showcasing my motion graphics and design skills.
This means that it will need to show different kind of skills such as: 



- Text animations,

-  camera animations,

-  procedural animations,

-  procedural texturing,

- procedural texturing animations,

-  particles simulations,

-  hair simulations,

-  liquid simulations,

-  mixed composting techniques



 All my projects starts with one element, the music. The music allows the ideas to flow in a specific way, identifying the mood, the phase, the amount of compositions and cuts needed to achieve a certain goal. The Music that I have chosen is this:

As can be easily noticed, this song defines a dark mood, fast jump cuts, a very long intro, and since I have only 40 seconds available, I need to have at least 10 to 12 compositions that might be repeated to fill some gaps. Since I need to have specific kind of simulations, I will not be able to keep always a dark mood, that means that probably I will need to colour correct in the clips afterwards.

Regarding the tools I have a huge problem. The industry standards for motion graphics are Maxon Cinema 4D and After Effects; and I don't have enough skills to use both of them. My tools for this project will be:



* Blender 3D v.2.83.8
  
  * Eevee (Renderer)
  
  * Alembic Export (Plugin)
  
  * Node Wrangler (Plugin)
  
  * Animation Nodes (Plugin)
  
  * Sverchok (Plugin)
  
  * Commotion (Plugin)
  
  * BY-GEN (Plugin)
  
  * Animax (Plugin)
  
  * Text FX (Plugin)
  
  * SSGI (Plugin)
  
  * Tissue Tool (Plugin)
  
  * Evy Gen (Plugin)

* DaVinci Resolve / Fusion

* 3DCoat

* Quixel Mixer

* Adobe After Effects (Only if needed)

* Affinity Photo

* Affinity Design



I choose this set of tools for many different reasons:

* Blender, 3DCoat and DaVinci Resolve are multi purpose tools and I have a very loose and unprecise creative process where I need to go back and forward between tools all the time; these tools grant me a very large amount of freedom

* Since, mainly I am a freelancer, I have huge amount of costs to sustain. These tools are fairly cheap in comparison of most industry standard tools.

* I choose Blender because my hardware is not that performant and I will not be able to render with the Cinema 4D Physical renderer or Redshift, and Maya Arnold would take too much time to render simple scenes. Blender comes with Eevee that is physically based real-time renderer. hanks to Eevee I will not have the need of a render farm.

* I choose 3DCoat just in case I need a wider 3d sculpting and texturing tool that is interfaced very well with Quixel Mixer.

* I will probably use After Effects for some simple editing technique and straightforward motion graphics.

* I use a huge amount of plugins for Blender because it lacks a lot of tools that are useful for motion graphics. Some plugins are shipped with Blender such as Alembic import/export that is needed to cache certain simulations and models inside the system
