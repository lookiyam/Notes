# Form Follows Function Concept Critique 
## The way something looks should be determined by its purpose

By ==Louis Sullivan==
It is a poor interpretation of what is reality
- Gather the products requirements
- Determinate the UI requirements
It is treated as 1 to 1 relationship -> it is not

This statement was a rebellion against the architecture style that followed the roman and greek standartds
the result? skyscrapers

==Lloyd Wright==
Believed that form and function should be one in a spiritual union
There is an integration between the two 

==Bauhaus==
Architecture begins where engineering ends
- the form had to reflect the function of the product
- Communication and meaning should never be sacrificed of visual design choices
- Artistic devices are used to increase the utility of the work

# Balance Forms and Function -> prescription vs description

## Description
beauty as result of purity of function -> form follows function in nature
Variation in form allows species to succeed -> due to competition of resources.
The winner has variations for productise that competes for sales, relevant and appropriate variations.
## Prescription
Aesthetic considerations in design should be secondary to functional considerations -> 
Prioritize functionalities over all other design considerations -> aesthetics is secondary
- What elements don't serve functions and should be removed???

==These are wrong perspectives and questions==

Because:
- if the from of a design was ruled solely by its functions, then every functional item would have one design solution 
- Every element would have the same design
- before an object form could be changed it would need to serve different function

## Reality Checks
### Users are frustrated when confronted with UI that reflects strictly with technical functions  

 ==Alan Coopers Implementation Models ==

IMPLEMENTATION MODEL = reflects technology
REPRESENTED MODEL= What designers & developers create 
MENTAL MODEL= reflects user's understanding

The closer it is to Mental model the best the UI it is for users.

==Do you need to understand something to use it? No=

It easy to build implementation models. one solution for every problem.

- We have a mental model that predicts the experience and tells us what we can expect
- When the UI sticks close to our mental models the use is easier
- When the use is easier we buy download, and promote

### Form should be determined by SUCCES CRITERIA - Not fucntion Not Aesthetics preferences
Outcomes not features

- What aspects of the design are critical issues
- what design trade-offs would least ha, the design success?
